I am Peter.P, an enthusiast currently hacking on some of my projects.

I love to work with cryptography, interpreters, compilers and distributed systems and retro computers. I am proficient with Elixir, ReScript, Golang, JavaScript, TypeScript and Dart amongst others. Currently hacking on wasm, retro systems and Phoenix LiveView (spoiler alert, I love it!)

As you might have guessed, I love lesser known programming languages and systems.
